## How to run this code
`python series.py`

## Tests

I used PyTest-watch to run my tests.

For the fibonacci and lucas series functions,
I made tests to check the following conditions / inputs:
- Check function exists
- input 0
- input 1
- input 2
- input a string

For the series function, I made tests to:
- Check the default behavior of drawing from the fibonacci sequence
- Check whether optional arguments for the first 2 numbers in the lucas sequence returned the proper output.
